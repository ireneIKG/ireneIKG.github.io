<!-- Theme:
For this assignment, I chose to focus on my favorite vacation spot. I traveled to Hawaii a few years ago, and made some great memories. 
I chose blue as the theme of my website, because I think it matches the Hawaii Ocean the most. 
The theme of my website would be some beautiful images of Hawaii, and also a table of the water activitie I liked the most.-->

        I visited Hawaii a few years ago, and it was one of the most beautiful place I've been to. 
        The view and the ocean was so amazing, and I had a lot of fun playing all the activities on the island.
        It was so relaxing to just jump into the Hawaii ocean, and snorkling or swim around with friends and family.
        I made a list of activities I liked the most, and hope you all enjoy my website!
